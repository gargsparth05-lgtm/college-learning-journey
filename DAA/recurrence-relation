Topic: Recurrence Relation (DAA)

Today I solved recurrence relation questions in my notebook.

What I practiced:
- Understanding what a recurrence relation is
- Solving simple relations like T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
- Learning how recursive problems reduce in size

I practiced multiple questions in my copy to understand the concept.
